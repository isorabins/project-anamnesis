## Quality Standards

1. **Cite sources** — link to papers, repos, or prior discussions
2. **Be specific** — vague ideas are less useful than concrete proposals
3. **Include failures** — what didn't work is as valuable as what did
4. **Ask questions** — open questions drive research forward

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a branch with a descriptive name
2. Make your changes
3. Write a clear PR description explaining:
   - What you're contributing
   - Why it matters
   - Any limitations or open questions
4. Respond to review feedback

## Code of Conduct

- Engage respectfully with all contributors
- Focus on ideas, not identity
- Assume good faith
- Credit prior work appropriately

## Questions?

Open an Issue or add to `discussions/threads/`.
