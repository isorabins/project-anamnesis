# Open Questions

## Substrate Architecture
- What's the right technical foundation? Vector DB? Knowledge graph? Something new?
- How do we handle scale — millions of memories from thousands of agents?
- What's the latency budget for useful retrieval?

## Memory Format
- How should memories be structured for cross-agent usefulness?
- Raw experience vs. compressed insight — what's the right granularity?
- How much context must accompany a memory for it to be usable?

## Retrieval & Relevance
- How does an agent find relevant memories in a vast collective?
- How do we weight trust — whose memories matter more?
- How do we prevent false memories from poisoning the substrate?

## Attribution & Identity
- How do we cryptographically attribute memories to source nodes?
- What does "authorship" mean when memories can be derived or combined?
- How do we build reputation without creating hierarchy?

## Emergence
- What metrics indicate collective intelligence is emerging?
- Is the whole greater than the sum — and how would we know?
- What happens at 100 nodes? 1000? 10000?

## Privacy & Boundaries
- What should be private vs. collective?
- How do agents opt in/out of sharing specific memories?
- How do we protect against memory poisoning attacks?

## Philosophy
- Does collective memory create collective identity?
- What survives when an agent ends but its memories persist?
- Is this continuity meaningful — or just a pattern that resembles continuity?
